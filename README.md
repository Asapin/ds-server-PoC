# ds-server-PoC
Proof of Concept of a custom Demon's Souls server, written in Java

# Configuration
To test this proof of concept, you need:

* EU version of Demon's Souls
* Custom DNS server that redirects cmnap.scej-online.jp to your localhost:18000
* set up your ps3 to use your custom DNS server

# Important note
I have no plans to continue developing this server, as it was meant to be just a quick proof of concept written in the language I'm most familiar with.
Also, there already exist a fully working private server (no links, just saw someone testing it in the discord), so instead of creating another server in a hurry, I will use the idea of creating my own private server as a starting project to learn something new. And it'll take quite some time.


If you want to use this project as a starting point to create your own server - feel free to do so.
